QfnDemoApps
===========

Demo apps for experimenting with QF/n

These are configured for my local workflow,
so you may need to make changes for yourself:

* The projects expect the QF/n libs to be in /fork/quickfixn
  (where I have checked out that project)
* The `cfg/` configurations expect that this project is
  cloned into `/dev/quickfixn`.
  Change those files if you clone it somewhere else.
